# Career chatbot 

The Career Chatbot helps graduating computer science students explore career paths based on their interests.
It asks targeted questions about their preferences, then recommends the most suitable career option and provides:

  -  A brief job description

  -  Typical salary range

This system reduces the workload for career advisors and provides 24/7 guidance for students through automation.

## Job Types
The chatbot can recommend one of the following five career paths:
- UI/UX
- Data Analyst
- CyberSecurity
- Software Developer
- DevOps

## ChatBot Training
  The chatbot asks the student about their interests (e.g., design, coding, data, infrastructure, security).

  Using these inputs, it selects the career path that best matches the studentâ€™s preferences.

   It provides an overview of the career, including:

  - Job description

  - Salary information

The chatbot is trained using AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) to detect keywords and respond accordingly, simulating a conversation with a career counselor.
